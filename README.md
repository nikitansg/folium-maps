Advanced Data Visualization: Folium Map using matplotlib Python

## Overview
This project focuses on creating advanced data visualizations with Folium maps using Matplotlib in Python. Folium is a powerful Python library for creating interactive maps, and when combined with Matplotlib, it enables the creation of rich, customized, and interactive geographic visualizations.

## Features
1. Creating interactive maps with Folium
2. Enhancing maps with additional layers and markers
3. Customizing map styles and appearance
4. Combining Matplotlib plots with Folium maps for advanced data visualization

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Folium-Map-Matplotlib-Python.git
cd Folium-Map-Matplotlib-Python
2. Install the required dependencies 
pip install folium matplotlib
3. Explore the provided Python scripts and notebooks to understand how to create Folium maps with Matplotlib visualizations.

## Usage
Use the provided code and examples as a starting point for your advanced data visualization projects that involve geographic data. You can customize the code to suit your specific use cases, data sources, and visualization requirements.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to the Folium and Matplotlib communities for providing powerful libraries for data visualization.
Special thanks to any data sources or datasets used in the examples.
